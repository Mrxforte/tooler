# Tooler

Tooler is a Flutter app for construction inventory management: tools, objects (sites), favorites, reports, backups, and role-based access.

## What the app can do

- Authentication with Firebase (`email/password`, password reset, remember me)
- Roles and permissions (`admin`, `brigadir`, `user` + `canMoveTools`, `canControlObjects`)
- Tool management:
  - Create, edit, delete tools
  - Search, sort, and filter by location/brand/favorites
  - Tool images (gallery/camera) with Firebase Storage upload
  - Location history per tool
  - Single and multi-select workflows
- Object (construction site) management:
  - Create, edit, delete objects
  - Search and sorting
  - Favorites for objects
  - Assign/track tools by object
- Favorites tab for tools and objects
- Profile actions:
  - Export inventory reports (PDF/text/share options)
  - Create and share JSON backup
  - Admin shortcuts (users, settings, move requests screens)
- In-app notifications state (read/unread)
- Local notifications + daily background task initialization
- Light/Dark/System theme support

## Tech stack

- Flutter + Dart
- Firebase: Auth, Firestore, Storage, App Check
- State management: Provider
- Reporting: `pdf`, `printing`, `share_plus`
- Background jobs: `workmanager`

## Project structure

- `lib/main.dart`  app bootstrap, providers, routing, theme
- `lib/viewmodels/`  state and business logic
- `lib/views/`  screens, dialogs, widgets
- `lib/data/models/`  app models
- `lib/data/services/`  services (reports, image upload)

## Run locally

1. Install Flutter SDK
2. Configure Firebase for your package IDs (Android/iOS/Web as needed)
3. Ensure Firebase config files exist:
   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire)
4. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

5. Run app:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Notes

- Main UI text is currently Russian.
- Some move-request provider files are scaffolded and can be completed if you want full request workflow logic in providers.
